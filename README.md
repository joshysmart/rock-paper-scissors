## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You can either choose the `original` designs for the simpler version or the `bonus` designs for the harder version. You will find both mobile and desktop versions of the design to work to. Each file is also named depending on which step in the game the design is for.

The designs are in JPG static format. This will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. This should help train your eye to perceive differences in spacings and sizes.

If you would like the Sketch file in order to inspect the design in more detail it is available to [purchase here](https://bmc.xyz/l/CYkacn7bV).

You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file, which contains the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.
